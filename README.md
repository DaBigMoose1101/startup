# Meal Share

[My Notes](notes.md)
## Meal Share Introduction

Meal Share is a social media platform that allows people to share meals, recipes, and other foods. This platform will provide a place for people to share their food with their communities. People can use this platform to launch their culinary businesses. This platform will give users the ability to peruse different posts about meals, post about the foods they enjoy making, access how-to videos, save and share family recipes, host live and digital events, buy or sell culinary delights, participate in or host classes, and get to know others in their communities. Nothing brings people together like food. The main income for this platform will be from individuals and businesses advertising products and services to nonpaying users.

You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

> [!NOTE]
>  Fill in this sections as the submission artifact for this deliverable. You can refer to this [example](https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example/blob/main/README.md) for inspiration.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Food and social media are the most powerful community builders. So I decided to combine the two. Meal Share is a social media platform built around sharing food, recipes, and cultures, and will also provide a place to launch and support culinary businesses. Users will create a profile where they can save and access recipes, like and comment on others' posts, make posts about their culinary adventures, access how-to videos, and expand their culinary horizons. Users will be encouraged to make extra food and sell it to their neighbors. Imagine if a ride-sharing app like Uber and a social media platform like Instagram teamed up to build society through food that is Meal Share.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - HTML will be used to create and format all of the pages mentioned in the key features list.

- **React** - Users will be able to interact with like, comment, and search buttons. They will also be able to select a user's profile or name to view the other user's profile page. There will also be a navigation bar so they can quickly switch between their feed, available meals page, their profile page, how-to video page, or create a post. The user will also be able to click on a button access the menu where they can create a group or business page. From the business page users can access the advertising interface. 
- **Service** - Back-end service with endpoints for:
  - Search results
  - Ingredient analysis
  - Advertising interface
